# FPGA-Based-Dust-Monitoring-System
Dust pollution comes primarily from the construction industry and related processes, like concrete
crushing, cement batching and road stone plants, coal mines. Pollution caused by dust and particles poses
the grave danger to people with heart or lung disease and other chronic diseases are at increased risk from
dust and particle pollution. Studies have shown that when particles levels are high lead to intensify the
disease. An IIT Kanpur study of Delhiâ€™s air last year says 38% of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 56% of PM
10 in the air is because of road dust.

The developed system has focused on checking dust present in the air. It is basically a Dust Density
Concentration Measurement System that makes use of the Wi-Fi technology available to transmit real-time
dust values of an environment to the HTTP server and which have been monitor by the web page and
android application. A range of equipment with sophisticated data collection and analysis software has
been supplied as part of a dust monitoring system. The optical air quality sensor used to sense dust
particles in the environment. The MicroBlaze Processor-based architecture of interface control unit
designed and developed with its peripherals to get access to data coming from the sensor and process it.
The processed sensor data configured with the developed HTTP server and Wi-Fi module. The web page
developed and configured with the HTTP server to show the dust density concentration obtained from the
sensor. The micro SD card linked with the HTTP server to provide web page related data to the end-user.
The android app has been configured with the HTTP server to show the dust density concentration on
android mobile or tablet.

FPGA based dust monitoring system is successfully implemented on EDK and SDK platform. The
entire FPGA based dust monitoring system is prototype on IoT platform by interfacing with web page and
android device. The developed design has been prototyped on Nexys 4 Artix 7 FPGA board with optical dust
sensor as sample. The developed system has focused on transmitting the real time dust values present in
the environment around to the end user using available Wi-Fi technology.
